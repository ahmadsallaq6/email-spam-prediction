**Overview**

This project aims to classify email messages as spam or not spam using various machine learning algorithms. Four classification algorithms were used and compared: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Decision Tree.



**Project Description**

Email spam prediction is a crucial task for maintaining the integrity of email communication. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether an email is spam or not. We implemented and evaluated four different algorithms to find the most effective approach.


**Features**

1- Preprocessing of email text data

2- Implementation of four different classification algorithms

3- Comparison of model performance based on accuracy

4- Visualization of results


**Algorithms and Accuracy**

The following algorithms were implemented and evaluated:

**1- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**

**2- Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

**3- Ensemble (Random Forest)**

**4- Decision Tree**


**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is the Spambase dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains 4,601 email messages, each labeled as spam or not spam, and includes 57 attributes for each email.

**Results**

The results of the model comparisons are as follows:

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): 95.5% accuracy

Support Vector Machine (SVM): 92% accuracy

Ensemble (Random Forest): 95.3% accuracy

Decision Tree: 91% accuracy
